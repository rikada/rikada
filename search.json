    "text": "{fig-align = “center”} My project, Heritable Variation in Genome Organization, investigates heterochromatin organization, intra-tumor heterogeneity, and cancer. The human genome is spatially organized within the nucleus, and heterochromatin is kept separate from euchromatin. Genome organization plays a role in cell function and is disrupted in cancer cells. Previous research has shown that low levels of linker histone H1, which is associated with heterochromatin, are highly correlated with cancer cell proliferation and cancer stem cell fate, linking heterochromatin specification to intra-tumor heterogeneity. I seek to understand the role of genome organization in intra-tumor heterogeneity. I use HCT-116 human colorectal carcinoma cells to investigate the variability of genome organization in cancer cells to determine whether genome organization is a variable and heritable trait in cancer cells. I sparsely plated the cell line to obtain colonies from single cells to investigate heritability. I performed DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, (FISH), and measured heterogeneity by comparing distance distributions between colonies and calculating the coefficients of variation in the pooled population. As expected, facultative heterochromatin marked by trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 exhibited more variability in cancer cells than in normal immortalized cells (IMR90). Furthermore, I identified specific probe pairs in cancer cells that exhibit heritable variation, which was not observed in normal cells. While heterochromatin organization appeared heritable after 10 days of colony growth, subcloning revealed that heterochromatin organization was not heritable after a month of continuous culture. We conclude that heterochromatin organization is transiently heritable in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells. Future experiments will test the duration of this heritability and its generalizability across different cancer cell lines."

There, I majored in Biology and participated in several different activities on campus, like tutoring and undergraduate research.

Outside of science, I am an avid reader and a musician that plays 3 instruments :)\n\n\n\nMy research interests are focused on the small sides of biology, in cell biology and microbiology! Specifically, in Finn Lab, we study genome organization! With the use of DNA Fluorescence in situ Hybridization, we measure spot pair distances to obtain radial position and 3D measurements. My research goals include working with my current and different cell lines and optimize DNA FISH in those cell lines to answer the central question of my project!\n\n\n\nAs I have mentioned, I have a broad spectrum of experience in science. I have been a tutor for several different subject in Biology, including Microbiology, Ecology, and Anatomy and Physiology. I have worked as a Lab Assistant for Microbiology and Biology at Oklahoma City Community College. I worked with Dr. Elizabeth Finn as a Post-Bacc and then now as a Graduate Student, studying genome organization. Currently, as a Graduate student, I am continuing my research with Dr. Finn!"

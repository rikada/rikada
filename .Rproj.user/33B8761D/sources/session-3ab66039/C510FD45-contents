#Wordle is a NYT game that requires its player to accurately choose the letter placement a five-letter word in 6 tries. From a publicly sourced database, the trends of different parameters of the game has been collected.M question is whether rarity of a word is correlated to Google searches!

```{r}
#To measure rarity of a word, I am using "word_freqcommonality", where 0.0 indicates rare words (ex:"wooer") and 0.04 indicates less rare words (ex:"about)
#To measure google search, I am using trend_day_language simply means the Google search interest for a given Wordle day word. In other words, the numbers correspond to a range of 0 to 100, where 0 is low interest, and 100 is high interest. Glimpse verifies the count of 58!

```


```{r, fig.width=15}
#In 2025, what is the correlation of Google searches and rarity of correct Wordle words?
# In the Q1 of 2025, the trends show that low commonality results in higher interest in Googling

  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = wordfreq_commonality, y = trend_day_language, color = date, size = 3)) 
```


```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=30}
ggplot(data = specific) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = wordfreq_commonality, y = trend_day_language, color = date, size = 3)) 

# Observing the first 6 months of 2025, there is less of a clear trend of the association of rarity of a word and google search interest
#So we can conclude that there is not a specific trend in first half of 2025 of rarity of a word and google search interest!
